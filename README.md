Horiseon Landing Page<br/>

All requirements for completion have been met.<br/>
Title has been fixed.<br/>
All links across the header of the web page are clickable.<br/>
The footer heading was adjusted to be in sequential order. <br/>
The CSS file was cleaned up so that multiple elements are now stacked if they have similar properties.<br/>
^The other option I could have gone with was to create a single title for all of the elements. I chose to keep their names separate in case there was a future instance that they needed to be separated by different CSS again.<br/>
All images were given alt attributes for better SEO.<br/>
Elements in CSS were placed in a more logical structure.<br/>
